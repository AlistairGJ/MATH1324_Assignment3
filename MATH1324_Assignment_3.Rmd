## Executive Statement

In your own words, provide a brief summary of the investigation. Explain the aim of the investigation, the procedure, sample, variables, main findings and conclusions. Write this section last after you have performed hypothesis testing. (Word count Max: 300 words)

### Introduction & Hypothesis

Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd (trading as Coles) and Woolworths Supermarkets (colloquially known as "Woolworths" or "Woolies") were founded in Australia in 1914 and 1924, respectively (1,2). Together, they make up more than 80% of the Australian market. Both Coles and Woolworths market themselves as extremely price competitive, whilst maintaining high quality products and a wide range (3). Over the course of this investigation, we will attempt to determine price differences between Coles and Woolworths by evaluating two hypothesis.

### Hypothesis A
While Coles and Woolworths both claim to be "low cost", invariably, one supermarket chain will have lower prices.

### Hypothesis B
In an attempt to differentiate themselves from each other as 'low price' (while still maintaining high quality & a wide range), the two major Australian supermarket chains, Coles and Woolworths, will employ different pricing stratergies to show consumers they have the 'lowest prices'.

### Data Collection NOTE THE WAY FULL PRICE AND SALE WAS COLLECTED.
The price comparison website www.frugl.com.au was used for data collection. Data was collected over three days (7 Sep, 17 Sep & 18 Sep 2017) within the postcode 3054 (Carlton North, Victoria, Australia). Date was noted as sale items will change with time (and thus collection was performed within an 11 day window). Postcode was kept constant as different regions will presumably have specials and full priced products based on geographies (for example shops in Queensland may sell mangos at much cheaper prices than in Victoria). Such assumption could be evaluated, however are outside the scope of this investigation.

Frugl allows filtering of products into a selection of distinct native categories, for example HEALTH & BEAUTY or BAKING. Categories were chosen based on the likelyhood of containing identical products. For example 'Nivea Moisturiser 200g' is manufactured and thus identical, whereas Coles may stock 'Fresh Celery 250g' while Woolworths may stock 'Farm Fresh Celery 225g'. These subtle differences make comparison harder, and so products like the latter were ignored. The native categories and their respective item counts will be explored below. For each item four prices were recorded; i. Coles Full Price, ii. Coles Sale Price, iii. Woolworths Full Price & iv. Woolworths Sale Price. If the item was not on sale, the full price was recorded into the sale column. This was done to for ease of data processing, as delta = 0 between the full price and sale column will indicate the item is not presently on sale. 

Data was collated into a Google Sheet, which was pulled directly into the R Markdown environment. See below for data structure and importation methology.

## Load Packages and Data
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(gsheet)
library(gridExtra)
library("htmltools")
ds <- gsheet2tbl('https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_6RZ0HXg7VbgO78oyFfUyZaFOUHYWijy8XH1_jw5tA4')
###Note - "Overall Coles in cheaper, in category x coles in cheaper... and so on"
```

## Summary Statistics

### Data Checking and Initial Visualization
The importation of the data set from Google Sheets as 'ds' was checked with summary, and the attribute names were also checked using sapply. During data collection, identical items available at both Coles and Woolworths were chosen. These items came from the following native categories on the Frugl website - BAKING, DAIRY & EGGS DIETARY, HEALTH & LIFESTYLE, DRINKS, FROZEN FOOD, HEALTH & BEAUTY, PACKAGED & READY MEALS and PANTRY, value counts can be seen below. During data collection, these items were re-categorized into the following categories - Beauty, Diet/ Gym Food, Sugary Snack and Supplement, value counts can also be seen below. For this investigation the allocated categories will be used, as they contain the same number of products but spread over fewer groupings. In many cases the allocated categories more accuratly group the products, for example in the code block "#Exploring the Allocated Categories" we see four items that easy can be categorized together as sugary snacks.
```{r}
#Displaying summary statistics
summary(ds)
```
```{r}
#Checking the column names and corresponding data types
sapply(ds, typeof)
```
```{r}
#Value counts for the native categories
table(ds$`Native Category`)
```
```{r}
#Value counts for the allocated categories
table(ds$`Allocated Category`)
```
```{r}
#Exploring the Allocated Categories
df[c(281,286,291,300),c(2,3,4)]
```
The attributes "Unit" and "Amount" refer to the unit of measurement the product comes in and the amount, respectively (see exploration code blocks below). Value counts were used to check the categorical attribute Unit. A scatter plot was used explore amount.
```{r}
#Exploring Unit and Amount - Data Selection
df[c(9,47,17,234,283,409),c(2,4,9,10)]
```
```{r}
#Value Counts for Unit
table(df$`Unit`)
```
```{r}
#Exploring Unit and Amount - Dot Plot
qplot(data=ds, x=Amount, y=ds$`Allocated Category`, colour = ds$`Allocated Category`, main = 'Dot Plot of Allocated Category vs Amount',  ylab = 'Allocated Category', xlab = 'Amount (g, mL, pack)') + theme(legend.title=element_blank())
```
```{r}
#Exploring Unit and Amount - Stacked Histogram
qplot(data=ds, x=Amount, fill = ds$`Allocated Category`, colour = I("Black"), main = 'Stacked Histogram of Allocated Category vs Amount', xlab = 'Amount (g, mL, pack)') + theme(legend.title=element_blank())
```
The exploration up until this point has highlighted numerous challenges working with the data set. The products are distributed between three units, grams (g), milli litres (mL) & pack. Pack has a different meaning in the context of the products. For example (refer to the exploring unit and amount code block above) Tresemme Extra Hold Hair Spray (75g) has units g, with an amount of 75. John Frieda Medium Ash Blonde Hair Colour (1 pack) has the unit pack (not volume or mass) and a quantity of one. In the Supplement category Ostelin Vitamin D & Calcium Tablets (180 pack) has unit pack and quantity 180. The data will be explored further and standardised, as described below.

## Exploring the Native Continuous Data with Scatter Plots
Prior to any transformations, the data was also explored with scatterplots (see below).

## Hypothesis Test

Use R to perform an appropriate hypothesis test to determine which supermarket is the cheapest. You need to explain your choice of hypothesis test, any assumptions and the significance level. 

```{r}
# This is a chunk for your hypothesis testing code.
```

## Interpretation

Interpret the results of the hypothesis test by interpreting the $p$-value and confidence intervals and commenting on the statistical significance of the findings. 

## Discussion 

Discuss the findings of your investigation. What did you conclude? What were the strengths and limitations of your investigation? What improvements could be made or what would you do differently next time?
